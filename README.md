# 📊 Power BI Business Intelligence Portfolio
### *Converting Complex Data into Interactive Visual Stories*

## 📌 Overview
This repository serves as a professional portfolio of my work in **Business Intelligence (BI)** and **Data Visualization**. Using Power BI, I transform raw, multi-source datasets into interactive, high-impact dashboards that empower stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

The projects included here demonstrate a deep understanding of the end-to-end BI process: from Data Extraction and ETL to Data Modeling and advanced DAX calculations.

## 🛠️ Technical Toolkit
* **ETL & Data Cleaning:** Power Query (M Language) for data shaping and transformation.
* **Data Modeling:** Designing efficient Star Schemas and managing complex relationships.
* **Analysis (DAX):** Writing advanced Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) for dynamic measures, Time Intelligence, and KPI tracking.
* **UI/UX Design:** Creating intuitive, user-friendly layouts with bookmarks, buttons, and drill-through actions.

## 📈 Featured Projects

### 1. Pharmaceutical Operations & Margin Analysis
* **The Goal:** Optimize wholesale medicine distribution and track profitability.
* **Key Insights:** Identified high-volume manufacturers vs. high-margin products to refine procurement strategy.
* **Features:** Dynamic margin calculators, manufacturer performance scorecards, and price fluctuation alerts.

### 2. Global E-commerce Sales Performance
* **The Goal:** Analyze consumer purchase behavior and regional sales health.
* **Key Insights:** Visualized seasonal trends and regional hotspots to guide marketing spend.
* **Features:** Interactive maps, Top-N product analysis, and Year-over-Year (YoY) growth comparisons.

### 3. Supply Chain & Inventory Intelligence
* **The Goal:** Monitor stock levels and minimize inventory shrinkage.
* **Key Insights:** Highlighted stockout risks and identified slow-moving SKUs to improve warehouse efficiency.
* **Features:** Gauge charts for KPI tracking and automated expiry date alerts.

## 🚀 Business Value Added
* **Operational Clarity:** Replaced static reports with real-time dashboards, reducing the time to insight by over 50%.
* **Profit Protection:** Built custom DAX measures to track real-time profit margins, allowing for immediate pricing adjustments.
* **Accessibility:** Designed reports that allow non-technical managers to filter and explore data independently.
